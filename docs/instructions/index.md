# ASHLAR Quick Start

1. [Install](./installation.html) ASHLAR.

> **Note:** ASHLAR is capable of inputting many types of BioFormats-supported microscope vendor file formats, but some formats require additional processing steps. Please check back soon for detailed instructions on how to verify that your data is compatible and how to correct compatibility issues.
	
3. [Run ASHLAR](./running.html).

4. Check the result of the mosaic image output using a visualization software (such as [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads))*.
